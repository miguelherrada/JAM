# JAM
The Jacobian Analitical Method.

This repository shows examples of application of a numerical method[1] for solving complex non-linear problems in different programming languages (Python, Matlab and Julia).
In the file "JAM.pdf" the method and its applications are described. The step-by-step implementation of JAM to solve the Burger equation is also explained.  The matlab, python and Julia codes for this problem together with the matlab code to study the non-linear oscillations of a liquid bridge are available in the repository.
